function path = computeBugBasePath( start, goal, PolyList )
% Computes the path a Bug would follow until it hits an obstacle.
% Function requires start and goal point as well as a cell array of
% polygonal obstacles and returns an ordered list of all of the points 
% visited by the bug along its path. Note that each polygon is 
% defined by a n x 2 array of counterclockwise points.
