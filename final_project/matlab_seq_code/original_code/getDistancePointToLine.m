function dist = getDistancePointToLine(q, p1, p2)
% Computes the distance from a point to a line.
% Function requires the point to test q = [x,y] and two
% points to define the line, p1 = [x1,y1] and p2 = [x2,y2].

% Short way to compute distance from point to line is using
% the following formula
dist = abs(a*q_x + b*q_y + c)/sqrt(a^2 + b^2);

% Alternative method is to find the orthogonal projection of q onto
% the line, and then find the distance from q to the projected point
%p_x = (b^2*q_x - a*b*q_y -a*c)/sqrt(a^2 + b^2);
%p_y = (-a*b*q_x + a^2*q_y -b*c)/sqrt(a^2 + b^2);

% Distance from point to line is then the distance
% from q to the projection of q on the line
%altDist = sqrt((q_x - p_x)^2 + (q_y - p_y)^2);
