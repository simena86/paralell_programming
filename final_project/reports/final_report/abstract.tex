\begin{abstract}
This paper was written as a final project in the course CS 140 Parallel Scientific Computing at the University of California, Santa Barbara in March 2013. The objective of this project was to make a program for parallelizing the procedure of sampling the configuration space of a 3 Link Robot Manipulator. 

When controlling robots in arbitrary environment it is necessary to sample the environment and check at which points the robot collides with obstacles, and and then construct a feasible path between points a start and goal point . This procedure is very time consuming for a robot with 3 degrees of freedom. 

A solution was therefore to parallelize the procedure of sampling and path generation. This yielded a close to linear speed-up for large sampling spaces.
