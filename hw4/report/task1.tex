\subsection*{Task 1 and 2}

In task 1 the number of processors where fixed to 4, and different sizes of n where tested. In Fig. \ref{fig:1} the speedup where measured against the size of n in a log scale. For task 2 the speedup where measured against different number of processors and with the problem size fixed to $n=10^6$

\subsection*{Task 3}

The innerproduct program was tested for $ 20 , 40 , 60, 80, 100, 120, 140 $. The test was run with $n=10^7$ and with $CILK\_NPROCS=8$. From Fig. \ref{fig:co} one can see that for the most part the running time decreases for increasing coarseness. This can be due to the fact that increasing the coarseness leads to a smaller number of spawns, resulting in less overhead.
